## New AVS Registrations
This week, we have added the following Abstract Validation Services (AVS) to our operations:
- EigenDA
- Brevis coChain

## Issues and Contributions
During the week, we addressed several issues and made contributions to the AVS ecosystem:
- PR #1: [Add systemd instructions to run Brevis coChain AVS](https://github.com/brevis-network/brevis-avs/pull/2/files)
- PR #2: [Add checks for RPC health in EigenDA](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenda/pull/475)

## Insights
- Brevis coChain: The repository only has the binary for Linux AMD64; no Docker image is available.
- Brevis coChain: There is no support for local monitoring of the node; only the AVS team can check the health of nodes since they monitor the health of the centralized service.
- Brevis coChain: It does not implement the full AVS node specification.
- EigenDA: It does not implement the full AVS node specification.

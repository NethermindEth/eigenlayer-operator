## New AVS Registrations
- Witness Chain

## Issues and Contributions
- Issue #6: [CLI does not check if Operator and Watchtower are already registered](https://github.com/witnesschain-com/operator-cli/issues/6)

## Insights
- Witness Chain:
  - User-friendly CLI tool for registration, installable via script
  - No Docker image for CLI
  - Supports L1 registration, L2 expected 22-29 April 2024
  - Requires new key for each watchtower
  - Automatable registration process
  - CLI doesn't verify existing registrations, risking unnecessary transactions and gas wastage
  - Doesn't implement AVS node specification
